# D3 LX community :two_hearts:

Hello and welcome to the D3.lisbon community sessions

The long term objective of these sessions is to create a d3 co-learning community in Lisbon and establish weekly sessions, similar to this [example](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/opentechschool-berlin/events/259259284/).

In order to establish a community we need to have some basic and common knowledge.
Therefore I planed to work together with you through the following [Book](https://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3) and
[Code example](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/releases)

As a working environment you need to have installed the ATOM editor [ATOM](https://atom.io/) as well as creating an account for the online editors jsbin [JSBIN](https://jsbin.com/?html,output) and blockbuilder [Blockbuilder](https://blockbuilder.org/).

Please fine more d3 learning material here: [D3 Presentation](https://slides.com/sandravizmad/d3js)

### The next sessions will have the following agenda:

In the first 40 min you will go through the content and play around with the coding examples planed for this sessions on your own.

In the next 40 min I or another coach are going to explain the code example and (try to) answer all related questions as well as discuss the concept learnt in this session.

The last 20 minutes are open for presenting own projects or interesting links/examples regarding d3. In case nobody likes to present I will present, but I would really encourage you to share as well in order to build real community atmosphere :)

Important: For those of you that already know/use D3 and don’t feel the need to go through the book and coding examples, I invite to come to the sessions and use the time to work on your project, maybe having a talk about it in the first 40 min and if you are interested present some of your work in the last 20 min of the session.

At the moment I’m hosting and organizing these sessions, but it would be great to share this role with others. :neckbeard: Therefore I’m looking for people, which already have some idea about D3 and help me with the coaching/hosting. The final goal would be to establish a similar coaching group as shown in this example for the [CSS class](https://cssclass.es/coaches/).

That’s all and looking forward to meet and code with you :)
